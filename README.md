# MisoDirectoryObserver

## Simple, lightweight, Swift directory watcher with callback

This is a very simple directory observer. Technically, it's nearly a one-liner, but to get it right is annoying. Hence this quick snippet. Plug this in your piece of code and reap the rewards of having a free callback whenever your directory is modified.

As added bonus, there is also an ObservableObject version you can use, that will get triggered whenever your folder has changed. This is great for displaying file lists. Derive from this class or us it as-is.
